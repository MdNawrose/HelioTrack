# HelioTrack
HelioTrack is a solar-tracking device that helps solar panels capture more sunlight by adjusting their position to follow the sun throughout the day. Unlike fixed solar panels, which remain stationary, HelioTrack ensures the panels are always aligned with the sun, maximizing energy production.
